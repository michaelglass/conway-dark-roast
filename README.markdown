Conway Dark Roast
=============================

Finally went and learned a little bit of Javascript (instead of perpetually just f-ing around with JQuery).  

New Toys:
---------
All of the code is written in CoffeeScript
Most of the backend code is tested using jasmine (again, with tests written in CoffeeScript)

Front end is using Canvas.  Works adequately fast in newer builds of chrome.  Slower in Firefox.
